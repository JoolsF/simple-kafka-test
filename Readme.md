Test project to experiment with Kafka and the Apache Java client library.
Intended to be run with docker kafka / zookeeper cluster using https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker

This is *not* how you would write a robust kafka producer / consumer. I wouldn't use 
use the Java client directly for a start.  These are quick toy examples for experimentation to explore Kafka
and the client directly.
